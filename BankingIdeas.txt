BANKING

Changes/Comments:
	[Andy/Richard] [11:22 AM 2015-08-12] *Created in Real Time*
		- Initialized, added concept

Concept:

    Players have access to banks, in which they can access an 'account'.
    In a bank account, money can be withdrawn or deposited by the thousands for a small fee.
    Each nation has a few major towns, which all have banks.
    At these banks, players must pay an entry fee to use a bank (once per bank only).
    After that, they can use those banks to access the same account.
    This means that a player can (in a way) buy memberships to banks all over
    to make it easier to acces gold, without having to consatntly travel on trips to retrieve
    their gold. The main incentive for players to pay the fines though, are from fear
    of monsters. If a player is defeated, 1/2 of their money is lost. The banking system allows
    for reliability, and gold hoarding later on in THE GAME when items begin to get expensive.
    Items though, always stay with the player, even upon defeat. This means that the 'account'
    is just stored as an integer variable.
