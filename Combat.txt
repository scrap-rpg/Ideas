	[Richard] <I am proposing an unusual form of combat in the form of *Energy>
	
General:
	Per turn, both players and monsters can 
	
*Energy:
	Similar to how most games require mana on spellcasts, Energy Spells/Attacks require Energy
	Instead, basic attacks and spellcasts generate *Energy, and the player will also passively generate *Energy each turn
	If the amount of *Energy reaches the maximum, it discharges and resets to 0
	A player can cast an *Energy Spell if (and only if) their *Energy is in a certain range, and will lose *Energy on spellcasts
	A player can preform an Energy Attack, if (and only if) their *Energy is in certain range, and their *Energy will remain the same
	
	This game mechanic should add a more dynamic play-style with players having to time their abilities.
	(This concept is based on Heat and Energy from League of Legends)
	
Types of Damage:
	Attack Damage (Damage done from basic attacks)
	Magic Damage (Damage done from spells/effects)
	Energy Damage (Damage done from Energy Spells/Attacks)

Armor:
	There are separate armor stats for each type of damage ie. :
		Armor
		Magic Resist
		Energy Protection
		
	Armor/Magic Resist/Energy Protection Calculation:
		% of Damage Taken = (0.2 * (defender.armor + 500) / (defender.armor + 100))
		This formula has diminishing returns, meaning that the more armor you have, the less damage reduction per additional armor point you'll get
		Damage Reduction details in file ArmorCalculation.txt
		
Anti-Armor (Penetration):
	The 3 anti-armor stats are:
		Armor Penetration
		Magic Penetration
		Energy Penetration
	
	Armor Penetration Formula:
		When doing damage calculation, reduce the defender's armor by the attackers armor penetration
	
	Flat Penetration:
		Reduce defender's armor by flat amount during damage calculation
		Capped at 95% of defender's armor
	
	Percentage Penetration:
		Reduce defender's armor by percentage during armor calculation
		Capped at 35%
