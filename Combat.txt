	[Richard] [???]<I am proposing an unusual form of combat in the form of *Energy>

Engage:
	While the Player is travelling in the wilderness (non-city areas), monsters will attempt to Engage them
	Per "block" the Player travels, there is a chance that they will have to fight a group of monsters.
	The chance is based on the average Agility of the group, and the Environment Agility (which steadily increases as the player explores more areas)

	
General:
	Per turn, players, monsters, and NPC opponents can either attack, use abilities (spells), or use Energy type moves.
	All entities can only do one move per turn (a move being a basic attack, spellcasts, or an Energy spellcast/attack)
	However, in a boss fight, all entities can perform two moves per turn
	The order of the moves being executed, depends RNG and the difference in agility.
		i.e. The chance of one of your Players attacking first varies 35-65% based on the difference of average Agility per person.
		(No formula yet)
	
*Energy:
	Similar to how most games require mana on spellcasts, Energy Spells/Attacks require Energy
	Instead, basic attacks and spellcasts generate *Energy, and the player will also passively generate *Energy each turn
	If the amount of *Energy reaches the maximum, it discharges and resets to 0
	A player can cast an *Energy Spell if (and only if) their *Energy is in a certain range, and will lose *Energy on spellcasts
	A player can preform an Energy Attack, if (and only if) their *Energy is in certain range, and their *Energy will remain the same
	
	This game mechanic should add a more dynamic play-style with players having to time their abilities.
	(This concept is based on Heat and Energy from League of Legends)
	
Types of Damage:
	Attack Damage (Damage done from basic attacks)
	Magic Damage (Damage done from spells/effects)
	Energy Damage (Damage done from Energy Spells/Attacks)

Armor:
	There are separate armor stats for each type of damage ie. :
		Armor
		Magic Resist
		Energy Protection
		
	Armor/Magic Resist/Energy Protection Calculation:
		% of Damage Taken = (0.2 * (defender.armor + 500) / (defender.armor + 100))
		This formula has diminishing returns, meaning that the more armor you have, the less damage reduction per additional armor point you'll get
		Damage Reduction details in file ArmorCalculation.txt
		
Anti-Armor (Penetration):
	The 3 anti-armor stats are:
		Armor Penetration
		Magic Penetration
		Energy Penetration
	
	Armor Penetration Formula:
		When doing damage calculation, reduce the defender's armor by the attackers armor penetration
	
	Flat Penetration:
		Reduce defender's armor by flat amount during damage calculation
		Capped at 90% of defender's armor

	Percentage Penetration:
		Reduce defender's armor by percentage during armor calculation
		Capped at 35%
