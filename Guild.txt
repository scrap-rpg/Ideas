	[Andy] Just some notes: [2:15 PM 2015-07-25]
		- Level Scaling refers to how the stats increase with each level up
		- Sub-Classes that have an asterisk before their name are the "Elite" Class of their element (eg. Tank)
		- Some Sub-Classes (noted as: **subclass**) belong to two parent Classes due to similarties from both (eg. Warlock)
		- Starred Sub-Class specials belong specifically to that Sub-Class. Others may be shared amongst Classes

		- Changed Meric (Sorcerer) to Hydromancer, changed Sorcerer's Sub-Classes abilities to element-based spells
		- Changed Air Ranger to Marksman, added Arrow Crafting and Bow abilities
		- Removed weapon lists beside Classes <It would be more efficient to have a chart of weapons and classes that they're availible to other than to repeat>
		- "Knowledge" refers to the recipes known for potions, crafting, abilities, enchantments, and spells initially
			- Knowledge of a <item>  refers to access to spells, abilities, recipes, and enchantments of that specific item
		- "Piercing" (aka. Accuracy) refers to the percentage of damage that ignores armour
		- "Enchantment" refers to a spell cast on an item or piece of equipment, as opposed to a normal spell, which affects a Player or Monster 
		- "Entity" is a general term for Players and Monsters
		- "Tension" refers to a state in which the affected entity builds up damage for each turn that it decides not to attack.
		  When it does attack, the state ends, and damage goes back to normal
		- "Alchemy" refers to the combination of items to create new ones, usually with combined traits

		- I think I added/changed so much that this barely resembles the original
		- Let's just say that at least 50% of the file has been modified, and that it would double the length of the file to document it all
		- Heheh, sorry :)
		- I guess I got carried away...
